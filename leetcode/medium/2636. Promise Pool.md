# 2636. Promise Pool

Problem Description:

You need to design a function that takes an array of functions that return promises and executes them concurrently, limiting the number of concurrent executions to a specified pool size. The function should return a promise that resolves to an array of results from all the executed functions in the same order as the input array.

Function Signature:
```typescript
function promisePool<T>(promises: (() => Promise<T>)[], poolSize: number): Promise<T[]>;
```

Example:
```typescript
const delay = (ms: number, value: any) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(value), ms));

const functions = [
  () => delay(200, 1),
  () => delay(100, 2),
  () => delay(150, 3),
  () => delay(50, 4),
  () => delay(300, 5),
];

promisePool(functions, 2)
  .then(results => console.log(results)); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of `Promise.allSettled()` and an async function with a loop to execute the functions in the promise pool concurrently.

Here's a possible implementation of the `promisePool` function:

```typescript
async function promisePool<T>(promises: (() => Promise<T>)[], poolSize: number): Promise<T[]> {
  const results: T[] = [];
  let currentIndex = 0;

  async function executeNext() {
    const index = currentIndex++;
    if (index >= promises.length) return;

    const promise = promises[index]();
    results[index] = await promise;
    await executeNext();
  }

  const pool = new Array(poolSize).fill(null).map(executeNext);
  await Promise.all(pool);

  return results;
}
```

Now you can use the `promisePool` function to execute the array of functions concurrently with the specified pool size:

```typescript
const delay = (ms: number, value: any) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(value), ms));

const functions = [
  () => delay(200, 1),
  () => delay(100, 2),
  () => delay(150, 3),
  () => delay(50, 4),
  () => delay(300, 5),
];

promisePool(functions, 2)
  .then(results => console.log(results)); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

The `promisePool` function executes the input functions concurrently, limiting the number of concurrent executions to the specified `poolSize`. The results are returned as an array in the same order as the input functions.

## Alternative Solutions

Certainly! Here's an alternative implementation of the `promisePool` function using async/await and a custom concurrency control approach using a queue:

```typescript
async function promisePool<T>(promises: (() => Promise<T>)[], poolSize: number): Promise<T[]> {
  const results: T[] = [];
  let currentIndex = 0;

  async function executeNext() {
    const index = currentIndex++;
    if (index >= promises.length) return;

    const promise = promises[index]();
    results[index] = await promise;
    executeNext();
  }

  const queue: (() => void)[] = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < poolSize; i++) {
    queue.push(executeNext);
  }

  await Promise.all(queue.map(fn => fn()));

  return results;
}
```

The main difference in this alternative implementation is that we use a `queue` to control the concurrency. Instead of using `Promise.all()` for concurrent execution, we create a queue of `executeNext` functions and execute them one by one. The concurrency is limited by the `poolSize`.

This implementation will also execute the input functions concurrently with the specified pool size and return the results in the same order as the input functions. Both the original implementation and this alternative implementation produce the same results. The choice between the two implementations mainly comes down to preference and specific use cases.
