# 2692. Make Object Immutable

Problem Description:

You need to design a function that takes an object as input and returns an immutable version of that object. An immutable object is an object whose properties and values cannot be changed once they are set. The function should ensure that any attempt to modify the returned object's properties results in an error or has no effect.

Function Signature:
```javascript
function makeObjectImmutable(obj) {
  // Your implementation here
}
```

Example:
```javascript
const originalObject = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
};

const immutableObject = makeObjectImmutable(originalObject);

immutableObject.age = 31; // This should throw an error or have no effect

console.log(immutableObject); // Output: { name: "John", age: 30 }
```

To solve this problem, we need to create a proxy object that intercepts any attempts to modify its properties. If an attempt to modify a property is made, we can throw an error or have no effect, effectively making the object immutable.

Here's a possible implementation of the `makeObjectImmutable` function using a Proxy:

```javascript
function makeObjectImmutable(obj) {
  return new Proxy(obj, {
    set(target, property, value) {
      throw new Error("Cannot modify an immutable object.");
    },
    deleteProperty(target, property) {
      throw new Error("Cannot delete properties from an immutable object.");
    },
  });
}
```

Now you can use the `makeObjectImmutable` function to create an immutable version of the object:

```javascript
const originalObject = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
};

const immutableObject = makeObjectImmutable(originalObject);

immutableObject.age = 31; // This will throw an error

console.log(immutableObject); // Output: { name: "John", age: 30 }
```

The `immutableObject` returned by `makeObjectImmutable` cannot be modified or have its properties deleted, making it immutable. Attempting to modify or delete properties will result in an error being thrown.
