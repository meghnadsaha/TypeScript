# 2755. Deep Merge of Two Objects
Problem Description:

Given two objects `obj1` and `obj2`, design a function to perform a deep merge of these two objects. The deep merge should combine the properties of both objects, including nested properties, into a single resulting object. If a property exists in both objects, the value from `obj2` should take precedence.

Function Signature:
```javascript
function deepMergeObjects(obj1, obj2) {
  // Your implementation here
}
```

Example:
```javascript
const obj1 = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  address: {
    city: "New York",
    country: "USA",
  },
};

const obj2 = {
  age: 31,
  address: {
    country: "Canada",
    postalCode: "12345",
  },
  occupation: "Engineer",
};

const mergedObj = deepMergeObjects(obj1, obj2);
/* Output:
{
  name: "John",
  age: 31,
  address: {
    city: "New York",
    country: "Canada",
    postalCode: "12345",
  },
  occupation: "Engineer",
}
*/
```

To solve this problem, we need to recursively traverse both objects and merge their properties. When merging objects, we need to check if the property is a nested object and recursively merge it as well.

Here's a possible implementation of the `deepMergeObjects` function:

```javascript
function deepMergeObjects(obj1, obj2) {
  const merged = { ...obj1 };

  for (const key in obj2) {
    if (typeof obj2[key] === "object" && !Array.isArray(obj2[key])) {
      merged[key] = deepMergeObjects(obj1[key] || {}, obj2[key]);
    } else {
      merged[key] = obj2[key];
    }
  }

  return merged;
}
```

Now you can use the `deepMergeObjects` function to perform a deep merge of two objects:

```javascript
const obj1 = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  address: {
    city: "New York",
    country: "USA",
  },
};

const obj2 = {
  age: 31,
  address: {
    country: "Canada",
    postalCode: "12345",
  },
  occupation: "Engineer",
};

const mergedObj = deepMergeObjects(obj1, obj2);
console.log(mergedObj);
/* Output:
{
  name: "John",
  age: 31,
  address: {
    city: "New York",
    country: "Canada",
    postalCode: "12345",
  },
  occupation: "Engineer",
}
*/
```

Now, `mergedObj` contains the result of the deep merge of `obj1` and `obj2`, with properties from `obj2` taking precedence.
