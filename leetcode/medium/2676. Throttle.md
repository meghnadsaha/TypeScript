# 2676. Throttle

Problem Description:

You need to design a function that takes a callback function and a time interval as parameters and returns a new function. The new function should ensure that the original callback function is called at most once within the specified time interval. If the new function is called multiple times within the interval, only the first call should be executed, and subsequent calls should be ignored until the interval has passed.

Function Signature:
```typescript
function throttle(callback: () => void, interval: number): () => void {
  // Your implementation here
}
```

Example:
```typescript
function printMessage() {
  console.log("Message printed!");
}

const throttledPrint = throttle(printMessage, 1000);

throttledPrint(); // Output: "Message printed!"
throttledPrint(); // (Ignored)
throttledPrint(); // (Ignored)

// After 1 second, the function can be called again
// So, calling throttledPrint() after 1 second will print the message again.
```
Sure! Let's provide some more examples to further demonstrate the functionality of the `throttle` function:

Example 1:
```typescript
function showMessage() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}

const throttledShowMessage = throttle(showMessage, 2000);

throttledShowMessage(); // Output: "Hello, World!"
throttledShowMessage(); // (Ignored)
throttledShowMessage(); // (Ignored)

// After 2 seconds, the function can be called again
// So, calling throttledShowMessage() after 2 seconds will print the message again.
```

Example 2:
```typescript
function logTime() {
  console.log(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
}

const throttledLogTime = throttle(logTime, 5000);

throttledLogTime(); // Output: Current time in HH:MM:SS format
// Wait for 2 seconds
throttledLogTime(); // (Ignored)
// Wait for 4 seconds
throttledLogTime(); // (Ignored)

// After 5 seconds, the function can be called again
// So, calling throttledLogTime() after 5 seconds will print the updated current time.
```

Example 3:
```typescript
function showCounter(count: number) {
  console.log(`Counter: ${count}`);
}

const throttledShowCounter = throttle(showCounter, 3000);

throttledShowCounter(1); // Output: "Counter: 1"
throttledShowCounter(2); // (Ignored)
throttledShowCounter(3); // (Ignored)

// After 3 seconds, the function can be called again
// So, calling throttledShowCounter(4) after 3 seconds will print "Counter: 4".
```

In these examples, the `throttle` function is used to create a throttled version of various callback functions. The resulting functions ensure that the original callback is called at most once within the specified time interval. Subsequent calls within that interval are ignored. After the interval passes, the function can be called again. The output shows the behavior of the throttled functions with respect to the time interval.

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the original callback function is executed only once within the specified time interval. We can use a timer to achieve this. When the throttled function is called, we check if there is an existing timer running. If there is, we ignore the call. Otherwise, we execute the original callback function and start a new timer to prevent further calls within the interval.

Here's a possible implementation of the `throttle` function:

```typescript
function throttle(callback: () => void, interval: number): () => void {
  let lastExecTime = 0;

  return () => {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastExecTime >= interval) {
      lastExecTime = now;
      callback();
    }
  };
}

```

Now you can use the `throttle` function to create a throttled version of your callback function:

```typescript
function printMessage() {
  console.log("Message printed!");
}

const throttledPrint = throttle(printMessage, 1000);

throttledPrint(); // Output: "Message printed!"
throttledPrint(); // (Ignored)
throttledPrint(); // (Ignored)

// After 1 second, the function can be called again
// So, calling throttledPrint() after 1 second will print the message again.
```

The `throttledPrint` function will ensure that the original `printMessage` function is called at most once within the specified 1000ms (1 second) interval. Subsequent calls within that interval will be ignored, and the message will be printed only once. After the interval passes, the function can be called again.
