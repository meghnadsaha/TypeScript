# 2754. Bind Function to Context Problem Description:

Problem Description:

You need to implement a `bind` function that works similarly to the native `Function.prototype.bind()` method in JavaScript. The `bind` function takes a function and a context (object) as arguments and returns a new function. The new function, when called, will have its context (`this`) set to the provided context object, and any additional arguments passed to the new function will be passed as arguments to the original function.

Function Signature:
```typescript
function bind(func: Function, context: any, ...args: any[]): Function {
  // Your implementation here
}
```

Example:
```typescript
function greet(name: string, age: number) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}! You are ${age} years old.`);
}

const user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
};

const boundGreet = bind(greet, user);
boundGreet(); // Output: "Hello, John! You are 30 years old."

const boundGreetWithAge = bind(greet, user, user.age);
boundGreetWithAge(); // Output: "Hello, John! You are 30 years old."

const boundGreetWithNameAndAge = bind(greet, user, "Alice", 25);
boundGreetWithNameAndAge(); // Output: "Hello, Alice! You are 25 years old."
```

To solve this problem, we need to return a new function that wraps the original function and sets its context (`this`) to the provided context object. We can achieve this by using a closure and the `apply()` method of the original function. Inside the new function, we call the original function using `apply()` with the provided context and the combined arguments from the new function and the `bind` function.

Here's a possible implementation of the `bind` function:

```typescript
function bind(func: Function, context: any, ...args: any[]): Function {
  return function(this: any, ...newArgs: any[]) {
    return func.apply(context, [...args, ...newArgs]);
  };
}
```

Now you can use the `bind` function to create a new function with a fixed context:

```typescript
function greet(name: string, age: number) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}! You are ${age} years old.`);
}

const user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
};

const boundGreet = bind(greet, user);
boundGreet(); // Output: "Hello, John! You are 30 years old."

const boundGreetWithAge = bind(greet, user, user.age);
boundGreetWithAge(); // Output: "Hello, John! You are 30 years old."

const boundGreetWithNameAndAge = bind(greet, user, "Alice", 25);
boundGreetWithNameAndAge(); // Output: "Hello, Alice! You are 25 years old."
```

The `boundGreet`, `boundGreetWithAge`, and `boundGreetWithNameAndAge` functions are created using the `bind` function and have their context set to the `user` object. They can be called as regular functions, and the original `greet` function will be invoked with the specified context and arguments.
